Process for creating new scenes:
  1. In IDE, create new javafx file
  2. The ide will then highlight a controller variable and ask if it should make the controller
  3. rename/refactor the controller name (it will probably not say "Controller"
  4. Open the fxml file in scenebuilder and profit!

In order to control size of scene in scenebuilder, do *not* specify the size in the controller file.

To move Main:
- Don't move Main!
- Commit to version control
- change the name of the package main is in
- make a new package
- move those other files to the new package
- if there is a problem, revert to that previous commit.  Try again.
Moving main doesn't seem to work, so that is my workaround.

To use a button to switch to a new scene:
# The short version is just copy one of my other methods, altering the param to "getResource" to match the name of the fxml file
- Make sure that the widget (button) has both an fxid and a field in the controller
- Write the method in the controller, (I've been using a MouseEvent as a parameter)
-- This method throws an IOException
-- instantiates a Parent with the name of the fxml file that will be opened (the fxml file of the new scene)
-- Instantiates a Scene taking the Parent as a parameter
-- ackk, I don't fully understand some of the commands necessary, so just copy them.  LOL.
--- they involve Stage, Node, either one or two casts with some weird nesting.  ??

To add a project to Github: (apparently intellij can't just make this happen even if given github creds)
- create the new project on github via your web browser
-- I think that you should avoid clicking the "add readme" button b/c that can cause initial push conflicts.  Could be wrong.
- git remote add origin <PASTE GITHUB URL>    (At the command prompt within the relevant dir)
-- I had to use the -f option (possibly d/t the presence of the readme mentioned above, note that this is dangerous
   if  the project is already established [you could overwrite an existing project])
